            On offering to help the blind man, the man who then stole his car, had not, at that precise moment,
             had any evil intention, quite the contrary, what he did was nothing more than obey those feelings
             of generosity and altruism which, as everyone knows, are the two best traits of human nature and
             to be found in much more hardened criminals than this one, a simple car-thief without any hope of
             advancing in his profession, exploited by the real owners of this enterprise, for it is they who take
             advantage of the needs of the poor.
